      calcurse is a calendar and scheduling application for the command line. It helps
      keep track of events, appointments and everyday tasks. A configurable notification
      system reminds users of upcoming deadlines, the curses based interface can be
      customized to suit user needs and a very powerful set of command line options can
      be used to filter and format appointments, making it suitable for use in scripts.
