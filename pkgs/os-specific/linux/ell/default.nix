      The Embedded Linux* Library (ELL) provides core, low-level functionality for system daemons. It typically has no dependencies other than the Linux kernel, C standard library, and libdl (for dynamic linking). While ELL is designed to be efficient and compact enough for use on embedded Linux platforms, it is not limited to resource-constrained systems.
