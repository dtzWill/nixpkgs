  ## TODO: ##     exa is a modern replacement for ls. It uses colours for information by
  ## TODO: ##     default, helping you distinguish between many types of files, such as
  ## TODO: ##     whether you are the owner, or in the owning group. It also has extra
  ## TODO: ##     features not present in the original ls, such as viewing the Git status
  ## TODO: ##     for a directory, or recursing into directories with a tree view. exa is
  ## TODO: ##     written in Rust, so itâ€™s small, fast, and portable.
